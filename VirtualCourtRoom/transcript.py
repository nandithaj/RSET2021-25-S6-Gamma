JUDGE: We are here for the case of The State vs. Rina Malhotra. The accused claims self-defense in the fatal stabbing of her husband, Vikram Malhotra, during a violent altercation.

PROSECUTOR: Your Honor, while we acknowledge that the couple had a troubled marriage, we must determine whether this was self-defense or a premeditated act. The victim was stabbed 17 times, suggesting excessive force.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Objection! The defense argues that the victim was an abusive husband. My client suffered years of domestic violence, and the final attack was one that could have ended her life. She acted purely to save herself.

JUDGE: Proceed with evidence presentation.
Witness Testimony – Neighbor Priya Sharma

PROSECUTOR: Ms. Sharma, you lived next to the Malhotras. Can you describe their relationship?

PRIYA SHARMA: I often heard loud fights from their apartment. Vikram would shout, throw objects, and threaten her. Many times, I saw bruises on Rina’s arms and face. She once told me he had burned her hand with a cigarette.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Did she ever indicate she wanted to kill her husband?

PRIYA SHARMA: No! She loved him, but she was scared.
Forensic Expert Testimony – Dr. Abhay Mehta

PROSECUTOR: Dr. Mehta, how many stab wounds did you find?

DR. MEHTA: There were 17 stab wounds, most of them to the chest and neck. The knife pierced the heart twice, causing immediate fatality.

PROSECUTOR: Does this indicate a sudden act of self-defense or an intentional killing?

DR. MEHTA: Typically, in self-defense, we see one or two defensive strikes. Here, the multiple wounds suggest uncontrollable rage. However, considering her history of abuse, it’s possible she was acting out of fear and adrenaline.
Defendant’s Testimony – Rina Malhotra

DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Rina, can you tell us what happened on the night of the incident?

RINA MALHOTRA: That night, Vikram was drunk and angry. He accused me of disrespecting his parents and started slapping me. When I tried to leave, he dragged me back by my hair and said he would kill me that night.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY: What happened next?

RINA MALHOTRA: He grabbed a kitchen knife and told me, "If I can’t have you, no one will." I wrestled the knife away, and when he charged at me, I stabbed him. I don’t remember how many times—I just wanted him to stop hurting me.

PROSECUTOR: If you only wanted him to stop, why did you keep stabbing even after he fell?

RINA MALHOTRA: I wasn’t thinking! I was terrified. I thought he’d get up and kill me.

case2 = """
JUDGE: We are here for the case of The State vs. Amit Khanna, charged under IPC Section 302 (Murder). The accused shot and killed Rajesh Bhatia in a public park, claiming self-defense after being attacked.

PROSECUTOR: The victim was shot twice in the chest from a short distance. The prosecution contends that Amit could have fled instead of using lethal force.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY: My client was outnumbered and assaulted. He was pinned down, and the attacker threatened to slit his throat. His actions were a last resort to save his life.
Witness Testimony – Park Security Guard, Sanjay Patel

PROSECUTOR: Mr. Patel, what did you witness?

SANJAY PATEL: I was making rounds when I saw three men attacking Amit near the jogging path. One of them, Rajesh, had a knife.

PROSECUTOR: Did you see Amit try to run?

SANJAY PATEL: He was on the ground, bleeding. The men punched and kicked him. He pulled out his licensed firearm and fired.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY: If Amit hadn’t fired, do you believe he would have been killed?

SANJAY PATEL: Definitely.
Forensic Expert Testimony – Dr. Nisha Rao

PROSECUTOR: Dr. Rao, was the shooting distance consistent with self-defense?

DR. RAO: The bullets were fired at a downward angle, suggesting Amit was below the attacker at the time.

PROSECUTOR: So, he wasn’t standing over Rajesh when he fired?

DR. RAO: No. It aligns with his claim that he was on the ground and being assaulted. """

case3 = """Judge: This court is now in session for the case of State of India vs. Ahmed Faizal and Viktor Petrov, charged under IPC Sections 121A (conspiracy to wage war against the state), 25 of the Arms Act (illegal possession of firearms), and 489B (dealing in counterfeit currency). The prosecution may proceed with its opening arguments.

Prosecutor: Thank you, Your Honor. The prosecution will establish that the accused, Ahmed Faizal, an Indian national, and Viktor Petrov, a Russian arms dealer, were involved in trafficking a shipment of illegal firearms, including AK-47s and grenades, into Mumbai through the port of Kandla. These weapons were intended for distribution to organized crime syndicates operating in India. The accused were apprehended during a covert operation by the Narcotics Control Bureau and the Anti-Terror Squad, where they were found in possession of 50 assault rifles, 200 hand grenades, and a stash of counterfeit Indian currency amounting to ₹3 crore. The prosecution will prove beyond reasonable doubt that these individuals were engaged in an international smuggling racket, endangering national security.

Judge: Mr. Faizal and Mr. Petrov, you have heard the charges against you. How do you plead?

Ahmed Faizal: Not guilty, Your Honor. I am merely a businessman dealing in shipping logistics.

Viktor Petrov: Not guilty. I have no involvement in arms trafficking.

Judge: Noted. Mr. Prosecutor, proceed with the evidence.

Prosecutor: Inspector Karan Mehra, you were in charge of the operation. Please describe how the accused were caught.

Inspector Mehra: Acting on an intelligence tip-off, the ATS and NCB tracked a suspicious cargo shipment arriving from Dubai to Kandla Port on May 10, 2024. This shipment was registered under a front company owned by Ahmed Faizal. Upon searching the cargo containers, officers discovered 50 AK-47s, 200 hand grenades, and thousands of rounds of ammunition hidden among imported electronics. Surveillance operations had also linked Faizal to a meeting with Viktor Petrov, a known arms dealer with Interpol notices against him for weapons trafficking.

Prosecutor: How did you connect Viktor Petrov to this shipment?

Inspector Mehra: We intercepted WhatsApp messages and encrypted emails exchanged between Faizal and Petrov, where they discussed pricing, logistics, and drop locations for the arms delivery. Additionally, CCTV footage from The Oberoi Hotel, Mumbai, showed them meeting with a third individual linked to an underground criminal syndicate.

Prosecutor: No further questions.

Judge: Defense, your cross-examination.

Defense Attorney: Inspector, you mentioned intercepted communications. Was the decryption of these messages conducted with proper authorization?

Inspector Mehra: Yes, all electronic evidence was obtained with a court-approved warrant.

Defense Attorney: Are you certain that these messages were sent by the accused and not fabricated?

Inspector Mehra: The forensic cyber team verified that the messages originated from Faizal’s and Petrov’s personal devices, which were seized during their arrest.

Defense Attorney: No further questions.

Prosecutor: Officer Aditya Rao, as the forensic analyst, did you examine the seized firearms?

Aditya Rao: Yes, the weapons were tested, and ballistics confirmed that the serial numbers on many of the AK-47s matched those from stolen Russian military stockpiles.

Prosecutor: No further questions.

Judge: Defense, your cross-examination.

Defense Attorney: Mr. Rao, is it possible that these weapons were placed in the shipment without Mr. Faizal’s knowledge?

Aditya Rao: The communication records indicate Faizal had full knowledge of the shipment. Additionally, his fingerprints were found on the cash bundles recovered from the drop site in Navi Mumbai, proving his involvement.

Defense Attorney: No further questions.

Prosecutor: Your Honor, in addition to the firearms and digital evidence, the prosecution presents bank statements showing large wire transfers between Petrov’s shell companies and Faizal’s accounts. This proves monetary transactions related to arms trade. The prosecution urges the court to convict both accused under IPC 121A, the Arms Act, and 489B.

Judge: Mr. Defense Attorney, your closing arguments.

Defense Attorney: Your Honor, the prosecution’s case relies heavily on electronic evidence, which can be manipulated. Furthermore, while my client’s company handled the shipment, there is no direct proof that Faizal was aware of the weapons hidden within. The defense asserts that Viktor Petrov is being framed due to his past records, and there is no direct evidence linking him to the shipment beyond circumstantial meetings. We request the court to dismiss the charges or grant a lesser sentence.

Judge: The court has taken into account all presented evidence, testimonies, and forensic reports. The verdict will be announced in the next session.
